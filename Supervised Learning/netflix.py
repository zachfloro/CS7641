ATTRIBUTIONS:
    This script makes use of numerous open source software packages that provide machine learning algorithm implementations, plotting tools, etc.
    For the decision tree, boosting, support vector machine and K-NN algorithm implementations I used the package Sklearn.  Please see the following paper for more specific information:
        Scikit-learn: Machine Learning in Python, Pedregosa et al., JMLR 12, pp. 2825-2830, 2011.
