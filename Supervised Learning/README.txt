This README file explains how to download and run the code in this repository.

The repository containing the data and code for this project is on a public github at https://github.com/zachfloro/CS7641


This project is coded entirely in python using an anaconda environment (environment.yml in the repository).

####### RUNNING THE CODE ################

1. To clone this repository open git bash and run the following command: git clone https://github.com/zachfloro/CS7641

2. Once the repository is cloned to your machine open a python prompt and navigate to the CS7641 repository on your machine.
	a.) run the following command in your python shell: conda env create -f environment.yml
	b.) run the following command in your python shell: conda activate base

3. To run experiment 1, in your python shell run the following command: python churn.py

4. To run experiment 2, in your python shell run the following command: python chess.py

NOTE: this code makes use of several packages (referenced below) but none of them need to be specifically modified to run this code assuming you install the conda environment in step 2
