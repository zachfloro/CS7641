This README file explains how to download and run the code in this repository.

This project is coded entirely in python using an anaconda environment (environment.yml in the repository).

####### RUNNING THE CODE ################

1. To clone this repository open git bash and run the following command: git clone https://github.com/zachfloro/CS7641

2. Once the repository is cloned to your machine open a python prompt and navigate to the CS7641 repository and to the Radomized_Optimization sub directory on your machine.
	a.) run the following command in your python shell: conda env create -f environment.yml
	b.) run the following command in your python shell: conda activate base

3. To run problems 1,2, and 3, in your python shell run the following command: python randomized_optimization.py
	a.) this will create all charts used in the report
	b.) NOTE: This will take a very long time to run completely

4. To run the neural network experiment, in your python shell run the following command: python neural_nets.py
	a.) this will create all charts used in the report
	b.) NOTE: This will take a very long time to run completely

NOTE: this code makes use of several packages (referenced below) but none of them need to be specifically modified to run this code assuming you install the conda environment in step 2
